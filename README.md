# Communication utilities developed for school project.

This repository includes the source-code developed to enable communication with an esp32 controller through the SPI-protocol. The repository lacks some of the developed modules and can therefor probably not be run without alterations, it can however still be used as an example of a developed asynchrounous communication protocol. The program uses RTOS and the communication thread can be found in ESP32::Process::Run()-method.
